# Passion-Project-A-look-at-the-NBA

Determining how much an NBA player is worth salary-wise is on the mind of NBA team owners everywhere. Once a player contract is up, an owner can do 1 of 3 things. They can either:

1. Overpay them to keep them
2. Pay them a fair contract hoping they will resign
3. Let them walk without a deal.

It is often not an easy task to navigate. Oftentimes even, NBA fanatics will debate whether a player is overpaid or not depending on their performance.
My goal in this project is to analyze data of the top 25 highest paid NBA players and try to determine if they are overpaid, fairly paid, or underpaid vs their playing performance. As a bonus, I will create a data pipeline that will upload the cleaned/transformed results (csv file) into a sql database.

For this project, I will be using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook/Deepnote, PostgreSQL and Apache airflow. I will be gathering data from different sources (api, csv files), cleaning the data, and analyzing the data. I will create data visualizations representing my findings as well.
